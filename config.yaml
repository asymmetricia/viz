    Content: |
      Hi! It's me! Your friendly neighborhood Tricia! Welcome to `viz`, a
      little site mostly focused on my visualization work for Advent of Code.
      Hope you enjoy reading!

      ## About Me

      I'm a security & infrastructure engineer. I mostly work on very large
      Internet systems, usually dealing with things like Go, Terraform, and
      AWS. In my spare time I enjoy baking, woodworking, sailing, circus
      aerials, rock climbing, bicycling, and video games. I live with my wife
      in San Francisco, where we raise our darling cat Chell.
