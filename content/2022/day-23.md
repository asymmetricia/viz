On day 23, we help the elves to plant saplings.

We're simulating a sort of automata, which is a regular challenge. The
interesting wrinkle with today's is that we're an automata that is moving
around a grid.

As the puzles get more frustrating I tend to have less energy after solving
them to produce fancy visualizations. Today's was a nice exception, and though
I didn't get on the leaderboard, I solved it without too much fuss. (Had I read
the problem statement closer, I might've made the leaderboard in part 1! Oh,
well.)

## Visualization

Showing off both my voxel render and the ffmpeg-powered encoding pipeline, rendering this visualization was a breeze, although it did get the fans working on my little ultrabook.

## New Features

No new features, but the MP4 encoder has a more idiomatic API now.
