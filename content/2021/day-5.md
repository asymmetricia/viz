Day 5 was fundamentally a visual puzzle, anyway.

<!--more-->

The puzzle involved the intersection of lines, and in part B, this included diagonal lines.

## Visualization

There's no embellishment to this visualization, really, and it's a pretty direct expression of the prompt. It has some abstract visual interest to it, I suppose.
