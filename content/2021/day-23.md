Day 23 was a twist on the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle.

<!--more-->

We have to stack like objects with each other, with restrictions on where and
how we can move them.

I didn't finish Advent of Code 2021 "during" advent; with a lot going on that
year, I ran out of steam. I did go back and finish the puzzles later (in
April), including producing this visualization.

Suffice to say, I did _not_ reach the leaderboard for day 23.

## Visualization

I put a lot into this visualization. We visualize both the process of searching
for available moves, and in addition we animate the actual movement. I find the
result to be quite visually pleasing and engaging.
