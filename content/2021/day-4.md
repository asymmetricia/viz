On day 4, we play Bingo with a giant squid.

<!--more-->

Being a Day 4, I don't recall this being a particularly challenging puzzle. We're given an input of a hundred "bingo" boards, and the series of bingo calls. Our task is to find out (in part A) which board wins first, and in part B, which one wins last.

## Visualization

If there's one thing I miss, having switched to a more accessible color
palette, it's that Tol's Vibrant palette doesn't include a good green. This is
for good reason- Red/Green color blindness is perhaps the best known form of
unusual color vision.

So this is one of the last visualizations I made that _did_ capture that
particular red & green Christmas aesthetic. Still, I'm happier that latter
visualizations are easier to read for more people.

## New Features

Day 4 is when I created my first font glyphs for 0-9 and wrote the code to
render them. Banner day!
