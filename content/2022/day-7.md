Day 7 involved parsing the output of a shell transcript.

The visualization for today shows parsing progress and current state, by
rendering the "stack" of directories up to the "current" directory, and
populating its contents as we read the input file.

## New Features

The main memorable enhancement here is the addition of a `/` glyph.
